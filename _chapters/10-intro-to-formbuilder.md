**FormBuilder** is a web application which allows bespoke forms to be created for the collection of data from a geographically-distributed group of users.  Once the forms are completed, the data can be used to generate reports for further analysis.

Forms can contain the following types of fields.

  - Text
  - Numbers
  - Option lists
  - Dropdown lists
  - Links
  - Date/time
  - Name, Address and Phone number
  - Email
  - File uploads
  - Maturity matrices

Raw data can be downloaded as a web page, Excel spreadsheet or PDF.


There are three main types of users who access FormBuilder. These types are summarised below:-

- **Administrators**.

    *Form administrators* include users who design forms, design reports, manage user accounts and permissions and other maintenance tasks for the tool. Form administrators are usually the form owners and tool support staff.

- **Reporters**.

    *Form reporters* create reports to query the data which has been entered by form users. Clusters and Health Board reviewers will be form reporters.

- **Users**.

    *Form users* are the staff who enter data into the published forms. GP practices are form users.
