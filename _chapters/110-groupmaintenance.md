A new group may be created by clicking on *Create a New Group* in the top-right of the list.  The screen will prompt for a group name and optional description.

On the group edit screen in figure 4.2b Group membership is assigned separately for forms and reports. Form access is assigned by moving users to the *Members*.  Report access is assigned by moving users to the *Reporters* list.
