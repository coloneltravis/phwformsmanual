Form categories allow forms for similar uses or earlier versions to be grouped together.  The forms list screen is grouped using form categories to make it easier to find a form.

To create a new form category, click on the *Create a New Form Category* button and type in the name of the category and click *Save*.

Existing form categories can be renamed by clicking the *Edit* button for that category.
