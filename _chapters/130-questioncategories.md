Question categories allow questions, or form fields, to be identified and grouped together for reporting purposes. Question categories are assigned to a form field on the *More* tab of the properties window on the section design screen. See [Designing Form Sections](/chapters/sectiondesign)

For example, a question capturing the number of staff at each practice could be used to create a report showing the number of staff at every practice in Wales.
Alternatively, all questions relating to a Practice Development Plan could be retrieved independently from the rest of the form.

This is a crucial stage where the form administrator should carefully work out the category structure for each question in the form.

The category structure determines which groups of data can be extracted by the report generator.

The usefulness of the report generator is linked to the categories assigned to each question.
