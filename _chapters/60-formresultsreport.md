The Form Results screen shows a list of all published forms with counts to indicate how many users have started and completed each form.

The data entered by all users can be downloaded in the following formats:-

  - Web page (HTML)
  - Excel spreadsheet
  - PDF document


  <div>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/reports_statusresults.png" | prepend: site.url }}" data-lightbox="statusresults-image" data-title="Fig 3.1 Form Status and Results report">
    <figure>
      <img src="{{ "/assets/images/reports_statusresults_small.png" | prepend: site.url }}" />
      <figcaption>Fig 3.1: Form Status and Results report</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </a>
  </div>


A status report is available to summarise the progress of each user completing the form.

If a form has been submitted for completion accidentally, then it is possible for form administrators to reopen them from this screen.
