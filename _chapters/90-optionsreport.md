The Options report will pull out the result data for every radio button, dropdown list and tick box fields in a pre-selected form.

The reporter may break the results down by Health Board or GP Cluster.

Data will only be returned for forms which have been:-

  - Completed and submitted.
  - Incomplete forms which have been **shared** by the practice at the designated level (cluster or health board).


<div class="warning-box">
  A practice may chose to share their data with any of the following groups:-

  <ul>
    <li>Other practices in their own cluster</li>
    <li>Cluster lead reporters</li>
    <li>Health Board reporters</li>
  </ul>

  The practice will have full control over the sharing of their data, with the ability to revoke it at any time.
